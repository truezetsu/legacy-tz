Instructions:

Here's how you can use this tool to edit how many costumes each character
	has and which costumes are assigned to each team.

1. Make a backup copy of your Legacy TE .GCT and .TXT codesets. 
2. Run Masquerade Tool.html
3. For each character, you can select which Fit<Fighter>XX.pac/.pcs is
	associated with each costume, and which ones belong to teams.
	You can also toggle which characters have second team sets.
	(ROB, ToonLink, and Sonic can be given up to 15 costumes and
	can receive a third team set. Wario can be given 14.)
4. Click "Generate Codes".
5. Open your .txt codeset. Use CTRL+F (or similar) and search for
	"Masquerade Costumes (2/2)" and you should come upon the code to replace. 
6. Copy the corresponding code you generated and replace the .txt version
	in its entirety.
7. Repeat steps 5-6 for each of "Alt Color Engine Data"
	and "Triple Teams For Ganon, Tink, R.O.B. And Sonic (Part1) "
8. Save your txt file.
9. Drag and drop your modified txt codeset over "gctconvert.exe".
	This will produce a RSBE01.gct file. 
10. Replace the RSBE01.gct file in your Legacy TE build (in the LegacyTE folder).

Limitations/Warnings-

	This tool was designed for use with Legacy TE 2.0

	The Masquerade Parts 1 and 2 are correlated, both were modified
	in Legacy TE. The codes generated by this tool are not guaranteed
	to work in other codesets.

	This tool only produces codes, and does not update the necessary
	files with corresponding stocks, BPs, or CSPs.

	There are costume ranges that each set of team costumes need to
	live in. The first team must be within the first 6 costumes. The
	second team set, if on, must be within costumes 7-11. The third
	team set must be in costumes 12-15.

	Many characters have costume-slot specific GFX/SFX in their moveset
	files that will not align with costumes if edited. Wario and ROB
	even have boneset changes between costumes which can cause crashes.
	This tool does not account for such behaviors. User beware.
