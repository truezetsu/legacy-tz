 . Fixed bug where if the weight editor or vertex editor were not visible, they would not update with vertex selections
 . Fixed bug importing PMD models

 . Changed bug reporter to submit the issue to https://github.com/BrawlBox/BrawlBoxIssues/issues

 Initial Release (8/9/2015)
 . Added checkbox to the CHR0 editor in the model editor that appears only on frame 0 (the bind frame) called "Update Mesh Bind Pose". This will literally change the vertices and normals to match the bone position instead of treating the transformations like an animation.
 . Added weight editor used to change a model's rigging, or the influence of bones over vertices. This editor can be toggled in the model editor under Tools->Weight Editor. 
 With this you can even do things as extreme as creating a bone tree from scratch and rigging a static model completely within the program, or unrigging the entire model after posing the bind state on frame 0 and then deleting all but the root bone. "Update Mesh Bind Pose" (mentioned in the above addition) must be checked while posing or else the pose will revert once unrigged.
 . Added button to toggle the vertex editor in the model editor under Tools->Vertex Editor. The editor itself is not a new feature.
 . Added support for viewing SHP0 morphed normals and colors.
 . Added support for permanently setting SHP0 morphed normals and colors to the model, along with morphed vertices. This is done via the "Set" button in the SHP0 editor in the model editor.
 . Added support for viewing and editing property values of Havok Physics files and exporting them as HKX binary and XML text files. Unfortunately the exported XML file cannot be opened in the Havok preview tool yet and the binary format is not supported by the tool.
 . Added bug report dialog that appears whenever the program throws an error. This will allow you to publicly report the bug to the developers on the github repository and try and save your work before the application attempts to continue (it may or may not crash).
 . Fixed bug where the 1st person SCN0 camera button would do nothing
 . Fixed rendering bug where if a model uses specular light but the applied SCN0 light doesn't have specular, the specular color would be all white instead of all black
 . Fixed bug where normal rotations on a model would not be updated and saved when rotating a bone in "Bone Edit Mode" (renamed to "Move Bone Only")
 . Fixed bug reading MDL0 models where if a bone's parent was located after it in the bone array, it would link improperly.
 . Fixed bug dealing with CHR0, SRT0, SHP0 and SCN0 interpolation under certain circumstances. 
 . Fixed bug where the "Save As" function in the file editor's right click menu in the model editor would do nothing
 . Named some previously unknown values in STPM
 . Downgraded BrawlBox back to .NET 4.0 for maximum compatibility and moved all .NET 4.5 code into the updater application. This means you will not be able to automatically update or submit bug reports without .NET 4.5, but BrawlBox itself will still work.
 . Moved "Export GLSL Shader" on MDL0 material right click menu to be above the delete button.

 - v0.76 - BrawlLib v0.23

  Hotfix 3 (5/26/2015)
 . Fixed bug setting "NeedsNormalMatrixArray" in MDL0 header again, woops
 . Fixed bug rendering GLSL shaders that use transparency on a computer with a locale other than English
 . Fixed bug writing SCN0s (would work in Dolphin Emulator, but not on the actual Wii hardware)
 . Added option to MDL0 materials to export the automatically generated GLSL vertex and fragment shaders for learning, reference, or external use
 . Updated CHR0 editor "Transform All" group box to be enabled even when no animation is selected

 Hotfix 2 (5/21/2015)
 . Fixed bug setting an MDL0 bone's next sibling offset
 . Fixed bug setting "NeedsNormalMatrixArray" in MDL0 header (caused issues with lighting in-game)
 . Somewhat fixed display of MDL0 textures using projection mapping

 Hotfix 1 (5/21/2015)
 . Fixed issue where the model editor would sometimes hang indefinitely upon closing
 . Fixed issue where sometimes after selecting an SCN0, you couldn't edit it

 Initial Release (5/20/2015)
 . Added support for shaders in the viewport! This means that (nearly) all object, material and shader settings will show in the viewport. 
 Models will now  render more closely to how they should in-game. (View -> Model -> Shaders, on by default).
 SCN0 scene lighting, fog and ambient lights can be applied to a model and edited in realtime by linking the model's materials to a corresponding lightset 
 and fog entry and then selecting the SCN0 in the model editor after changing the edit type to SCN.
 NOTE that this feature (rendering shaders in general) is not flawless. Here's a list of things that DO NOT WORK:
	- Indirect textures, including normal maps and fur maps
	- Projection (texture stays the same in relation to the screen), Env Spec (texture faces point between ref camera and ref light), Env Light (texture faces light) texture reference map modes
	- Blending of some intensity textures (there's a hard line where the texture should blend into the background nicely instead)
	- Binormals for texture coordinates (Binormals are not supported by BrawlBox at all)
	- "Emboss Map" for texture reference "Type", "EmbossSource" and "EmbossLight" (under XF TexGen Flags)
	- "CompareBeforeTexture" under Z Mode in material properties (this allows for comparing depth before any texture transparency is applied)
. Added options to MDL0 bone right click menu to move the current bone to the end of the bone array or regenerate the bone array (all bone indices are reassigned). 
You can also change the bone's Bone Index in the array. This doesn't have an effect on heirarchy, but allows you to inject bones without affecting the bone indices of others.
. Moved "AutoMetalMaterials" option from the MDL0 properties to the right click menu under the name "Regenerate Metal Materials".
. Added options to automatically rename all vertex, normal, uv and color sets in an MDL0 in the MDL0 right click menu under "Auto Name Assets".
. Updated the "Reimport Meshes" option in the MDL0 right click menu to handle a wider variety of scenarios 
(this button will allow you to reimport the meshes of a model from a Collada .dae while preserving all other edits made in BrawlBox)
. Changed SCN0 right click menu to display but not highlight a newly added node (this allows you to add many entries at once with the shortcut keys)
. Added file manager to model editor, allowing you to open models and animations from multiple files at once. Expand the right panel in the model editor and 
change the dropdown to "Files". Right click a file in the list for more options, double click to open that file in the main window.
. Changed the model editor to not close the main window upon opening. This allows you to make changes to things such as MDL0 materials and shaders and see 
your changes immediately show on the model. This also allows for some other "unintentional features", such as opening more than one model editor at once. (Things can get wonky)
. Fixed bug where collisions would not rotate with their attached bone properly
. Fixed bug dealing with saving RSAR sound archives after making any edits
. Added option to add multiple "draw calls" to an MDL0 object. This allows you to render the same object more than once using a different material, visibility bone, draw priority, and/or XLU/OPA draw pass.
. Fixed support for viewing an SCN0 camera in first person in the model editor (View -> Viewport -> 1st Person SCN0 Camera)
. Fixed support for loading a background image in the model editor
. Added option to change the bone/vertex transform tool to World or Local space (only world is available for vertex selections). Local is default and means 
that the coordinate axes are relative to that bone, and dragging on an axis will only change that axis value in an animation. World means that the 
coordinate axes are relative to the floor, and dragging on an axis may affect multiple axis values in an animation. (View -> Viewport -> Transform Control -> Translate/Rotate/Scale -> World/Local)
. Added "After Rotation" option to change the local bone/vertex translation tool to apply before or after the bone's rotation.
Transforms are applied in order of Translate, Rotate, Scale, so this option changes the tool to work in the order of Rotate, Translate, Scale. "After Rotation" is off by default. (View -> Viewport -> Transform Control -> Translate -> After Rotation)
. Added options to model editor settings dialog (Options -> Settings):
	- Current Viewport -> Lighting -> Enabled: This will enable or disable built-in lighting in the viewport. SCN0 lighting may still be applied.
	- General -> Scale bone with camera: This will keep each bone at a fixed size on the screen. Especially useful for stage editing.
	- General -> Display bones as points: This will render each bone as a point instead of an orb with axes. Useful for reducing visual clutter, such as when viewing bones that are close together (like fingers).
	- General -> Hide main window: hides the main brawlbox window when the model editor is open.
	- General -> Per pixel lighting: This renders models with more accurate lighting calculations. This isn't what the Wii uses, but it usually looks better than per vertex lighting (especially with specular highlights).
. Fixed undo/redo in the model editor. Doesn't seem to have any issues anymore.
. Added support for rotating and scaling vertex selections (you can use E, R, T to change the transform control).
. Fixed bug saving/reading SCN0 lights; SCN0s saved in older versions of BrawlBox may not open properly anymore
. Added option to enable or disable billboard bones in the model viewer (View -> Model -> Billboard Bones)
. Added option to display SCN0 light and camera indicators in the model viewer when editing an SCN0 (View -> Animations -> Show SCN0 Lights/Cameras)
. Added "Average" button to vertex editor (the vertex editor is accessible by pressing J in the model editor). This will move all selected vertices to an average point between all of them.
. Updated interpolation viewer to handle two keyframes on one frame (used for step or linear interpolation)
. Fixed interpolation between the first and last keyframes on a looped animation if they are not the on THE first and last frames
. Fixed parsing RGBA6 color entries
. Renamed several MDL0 shader/material property/value names to be more intuitive and consistent
. Fixed bug reloading a texture with the realtime texture folder (in the model editor, Tools -> Live Texture Folder. This allows you to edit an image externally and BrawlBox will load it on the model without any interaction necessary)
. Added "Bone Edit Mode" to the CHR0 editor in the model editor. When on frame 0 (the bind frame), this is a checkbox that allows you to move bones without moving any rigged model meshes (good for stage making)
. Support for changing an MDL0 object's single bind influence without the object itself moving (also good for stage making)
. When changing a color in the color array editor in the model editor, the changed color will immediately reflect in the viewer as you change the value in the dialog (CLR0, SCN0 light/ambient/specular color, etc)
. Support for viewing lines and points in the texture coordinate renderer
. Support for viewing just about all texture reference properties (min/mag filter, lod bias, UV wrap mode, scale/rotation/translation, palette) in relation to the texture coordinates in the texcoord renderer
. Fixed bug with animated GIF importer (right click BRRES -> Import -> Animated GIF) where some GIFs would have transparent pixels in frames where colored pixels should be
. Added support for changing some CHR0 entry flags (go to the bone entry itself and view its properties) that were not previously available to edit. They are not currently supported by the model editor.
. Fixed bug importing normals properly from Collada dae under certain circumstances

 Initial Release (1/6/2015):
	. Fixed bug where the file's compression type was not displayed
	. Loop frame is no longer included when playing an animation. This is how it works in-game; the loop frame is only for interpolation from the last frame to the first and therefore only included for CHR0, SRT0, SHP0, and SCN0
	. Fixed several bugs involving the loop frame
	. Fixed bug where IA4 alpha and intensity were swapped
	. Fixed bug where a raw data node would appear when opening an unrecognizable file format instead of showing a message

	. Fixed bug where detaching and reattaching the model panel as a separate window did not work
	. Fixed bug when trying to view the interpolation of SHP0 nodes
	. Fixed model viewer screenshot hotkeys
	. Fixed bug where PAT0 animations did not save texture/palette names properly
	. Fixed bug where models no longer clipped with the floor in the model viewer
	. Fixed bug when opening the collision editor
	. Fixed bug where isotropic animations (isotropic means all the values are the same, so this is usually scale) were not parsed correctly
	. Fixed bug where PMD models could no longer be imported
	. Fixed bug where the vertex editor did not appear in the model viewer when using the "J" hotkey
	. Removed MDL0 material light channel count and instead added "enabled" to each light channel's properties
	. Renamed MDL0 material "ZCompareLoc" property to "CompareBeforeTexture" and added it under "Z Mode".
	. Fixed bug where MDL0 textures that aren't used by any object were written to the model (metal00 for Brawl models).
	. Added TPL, EFLS, REFF and REFT as nodes that can be created from scratch
	. Fixed bug where billboard bones did not apply in the model panel
	. Added option to zoom precisely in the model viewer by pressing the middle mouse button and dragging

	. Moved option to edit all models out of the dropdown in the model viewer and into the settings area under Options->Settings
	. Added tool to search for animations at the top of the animation list in the model viewer
	. Added option to MDL0 right click menu to recalculate and set bounding boxes at bind state (model and visibility bone boxes)
	. Added options to render visibility bone boxes, model boxes, and object boxes separately under View->Model->'Bounding Boxes' in the model viewer
	. Added option to render the bounding boxes that have been written to the model on frame 0 (the bind state) instead of rendering the auto-calculated ones. This option is located under Options->Settings in the model viewer
	. Branch opcodes are now highlighted in purple in the module section editor.
	. Branch offset destinations are now included in the module section editor's list box, highlighted in blue. Command destinations are highlighted in green.
	. REL Section 5 object parser has been added back
	. Added the option to manually set a bone's billboard reference bone.

 - v0.74- (12/25/2014) - BrawlLib v0.21
	. Brawlbox can now check for updates on startup (can be enabled via Tools->Settings) or when you go to Help->"Check for updates" and automatically install that update for you, in another folder or in place of the current version.
	. Support for adding new collision nodes to ARC via right click.
	. Support for adding new BLOC to ARC via right click.
	. Support for editing and adding the following nodes found in BLOC archives:
		- GSND sound files
		- ADSJ StepJump files, required to link rooms and levels.
		- GDOR Adventure door files, requires rooms linked via ADSJ.
	. Support for item frequency nodes.
	. BrawlBox now displays redirected nodes with their own icon
	. Fixed setting redirect index.
	. Fixed embedded module files (common2 and common3) not parsing.
	. Fixed BBox crashing when no vertices exist in Target model.
	. Fixed alignment of the frame indicator with the mouse when dragging it in the interpolation editor.
	. Fixed shader0's tex ref not being set when importing .dae files.
	. Fixed always asking to save after opening the collision editor, regardless if things were changed.
	. Fixed IA8 texture bug where alpha and intensity were swapped
	. Fixed frame counts on looped animations with keyframes (CHR0, SRT0, SHP0, SCN0): there is an extra loop frame at the end
	. Added proper texture matrix support that uses the Texture Matrix Mode included in SRT0, MDL0 and MDL0 material properties.
	. Fixed bug where if two keyframes were on the same frame, the second overwrote the first. Now, for example, Game&Watch's animations now display properly.
	. Fixed several SCN0 rebuilding bugs including when changing the frame count or using animated color arrays would cause the file to save improperly
	. Fixed Collada importer bug that occured when mesh nodes were nested inside another. Their bind matrices were not multiplied with the previous node, causing the imported object's mesh to be out of place.
	. Fixed Collada importer bug that occured when the imported model had no normals.
	. Fixed Collada importer bug that occured when the imported model had some rigged and some unrigged objects. Unrigged objects are now rigged to the first bone.
	. Fixed bug where opening environment settings would radically enlarge various rendered items. (bone controls, overlays, etc.)
	. Changing tool via options->viewer->bone control or shortcuts E,R, and T now updates Tool dropdown and vice versa.
	. Model editor now displays bones that are not part of the currently selected model at half opacity, and in a red color.
	. Section editor now displays number of selected bytes, rather than length of the full section. (bottom status bar)
	. GCT editor saves unchecked codes as disabled in .txt (pads the left side with an asterisk). Saving as GCT will not save disabled codes
	. GCT editor now allows multiline descriptions in .txt files.
	. Improved pixel format conversion, furthering its acuracy. (see details here: https://github.com/libertyernie/brawltools/pull/14)
	. Fixed scaling of bone control in the model previewer when changing the "Y Field Of View" in the environment settings window under Menu->Options
	. Added experimental support for orthographic projection in the viewport. Toggleable under Menu->Options->Environment Settings->Orthographic. 
		Note: there are problems with this, such as billboard bones and the scaling of the bone edit control. Orthographic cameras look AT their origin point, while perspective cameras look OUT from their origin point.
	. Added a live texture folder to the model previewer. Select a folder under Menu->Tools->"Live Texture Folder" and any textures with names that match the model's textures will be auto-loaded on the model when modified.
	. Added a small dialog in the collision editor to rotate/translate/scale selected planes by specific values.
	. Object / Method editor has been added to the module editor pending a better UI for it.
		- Right click on methods allows you to open the Method's Assembly in section editor.
		- Right click on inheritance items will open the section editor to THAT INSTANCE'S declaration, before the object's vTable.
		- PPC disassembler now stops at branch commands in addition to blr.
		- Added a button to the disassembler that is only visible when a branch command is selected, allowing you to jump to that location.
	. Better support for MDL0 billboard bones. Can now render properly in the viewer and be properly set in the bone's properties.
