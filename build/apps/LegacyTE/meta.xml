		<long_description>Legacy Tournament Edition is a custom build of Project M that aims to be an alternate option to Project M 3.6 for use in tourneys, smash fests, and netplay matches. TE leaves PM 3.6's character roster, movesets, and universal physics engine untouched while offering additional tourney-legal skins and stages. Project M, the modification of Brawl upon which TE is based, is inspired by Super Smash Bros. Melee's gameplay and brings technical variety to all characters.</long_description>
